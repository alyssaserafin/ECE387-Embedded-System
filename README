In this final project, I will be creating an ATM. I will use a keypad to have the user enter in their pin number and the type of transaction they wish to perform. I will use a LCD to act as the display screen that relays prompts about withdrawals, deposits, welcome messages, etc. It will also communicate what is typed on the keypad.
